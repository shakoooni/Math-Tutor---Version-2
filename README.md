📘 Summary

This isn’t just a program… it’s your personal math gym.
Every time you run it, it throws a new random challenge your way — addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

But don’t worry — no fractions, no negatives. Just clean, kid-friendly math.
Think of it as a sparring match between you and numbers.
